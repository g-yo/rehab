    <h2>BMW M 1000 R OVERVIEW & PRICE</h2>

     <h3>PERFORMANCE AND ENGINE</h3>
     The BMW M 1000 R is powered by a formidable 999 cc water/oil-cooled 4-cylinder 4-stroke in-line engine featuring BMW's innovative ShiftCam technology. This powerplant delivers an astounding 152 kW (210 hp) at 13,750 rpm and a maximum torque of 113 Nm at 11,000 rpm. These figures translate into real-world performance that is truly breathtaking. The M 1000 R's acceleration capabilities are in the superbike territory, making it a thrilling ride for any enthusiast.
       
     It can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h in a mere 3.1 seconds, reach 150 km/h in 4.9 seconds, and hit 200 km/h in just 7.2 seconds. For those who crave speed, the M 1000 R boasts a top speed of 280 km/h. What sets the M 1000 R apart is its raw power and how it is delivered. The bike offers multiple riding modes - Rain, Road, Dynamic, Race, and Race Pro - each tailored to specific riding conditions and preferences. These modes are linked to particular accelerator characteristics, ensuring optimal response in various scenarios.
     

      <h3>MILEAGE AND FUEL EFFICIENCY</h3>
      While the BMW M 1000 R is primarily designed for performance, fuel efficiency is still a consideration for many Indian riders. The bike has an ARAI (Automotive Research Association of India) certified mileage of 15.6 kmpl, a standard measure used to compare the fuel efficiency of different vehicles. This figure, certified by a reputable automotive research organization, provides a reliable benchmark for comparing the M 1000 R's fuel efficiency with other motorcycles. However, it's important to note that real-world fuel efficiency can vary significantly based on riding style, traffic conditions, and maintenance. Under the World Motorcycle Test Cycle (WMTC) standards, the M 1000 R is rated at 6.4 litres per 100 km. This suggests a more efficient fuel consumption under controlled conditions.

      However, during high-performance track sessions, fuel economy has been observed to drop to around 7-8km/l, highlighting the impact of aggressive riding on fuel efficiency. Given these figures, the M 1000 R's fuel efficiency is better than only 6% of sports bikes in its category, indicating that it prioritizes performance over economy. Riders in India should expect variations in fuel efficiency based on their specific riding habits and local conditions.
      

       <h3>FEATURES AND TECHNOLOGY</h3>
       The BMW M 1000 R is packed with features that enhance both its performance and rider experience:
